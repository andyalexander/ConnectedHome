# remoteSniffer

Some sample code to read 315/433 mhz raw signals on a nodeMCU

This was adapted from code found elsewhere, which failed to run on the node, mainly due to the keyboard handling.

Note, as per the original author, I had to put a 100nf cap between the signal and ground to remove any noise
